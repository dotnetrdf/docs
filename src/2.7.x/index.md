# dotNetRDF Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for dotNetRDF.

The documentation is split into 4 main parts:

  * [User Guide](user_guide/index.md) is intended for developers wanting to use the library.
  * [How-To Guides](howto/index.md) gives short, focussed articles on performing specific tasks with the library.
  * [Developer Guide](developer_guide/index.md) is intended for developers intending to work on the internals of dotNetRDF or to build store integrations for the library.
  * [API Documentation](api/VDS.RDF.yml) is the class-by-class detailed documentation generated from the source code.

In addition to those sections you will also find a few [FAQs](faq/index.md) and information on how to get [Support](support/index.md)
