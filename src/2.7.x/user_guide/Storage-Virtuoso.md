# Virtuoso 

You can connect to an [OpenLink Virtuoso](http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com) server using the [VirtuosoManager](xref:VDS.RDF.Storage.VirtuosoManager) class.  
Since this requires additional dependencies in the form of the Virtuoso ADO.Net provider this functionality is in the separate library **dotNetRDF.Data.Virtuoso.dll**

## Supported Capabilities 

* Load, Save, Delete, Update and List Graphs
* SPARQL Query and Update

Note that SPARQL Query and Update is subject to the peculiarities of the Virtuoso implementation which is well known for having various quirks and non-standard SPARQL extensions.

## Creating a Connection 

Assuming a standard Virtuoso installation you can connect like so:

```csharp

VirtuosoManager virtuoso = new VirtuosoManager("localhost", VirtuosoManager.DefaultDB, "username", "password");
```

If you are running with a non-standard port then you can specify that like so:

```csharp

VirtuosoManager virtuoso = new VirtuosoManager("localhost", 1234, VirtuosoManager.DefaultDB, "username", "password");
```

> [!NOTE]
> The port you provide is that of the SQL interface not that of the HTTP server, in a default installation this is #1111# or the constant [`VirtuosoManager.DefaultPort`](xref:VDS.RDF.Storage.VirtuosoManager.DefaultPort)

Advanced users may wish to configure the Virtuoso connection string manually in which case you can do this:

```csharp

VirtuosoManager virtuoso = new VirtuosoManager("Connection String");
```

## Using Virtuoso SPARQL Extensions 

Our implementation does its best to cope with Virtuoso SPARQL extensions but this is not always perfect, if you run into trouble please ask for [Support](../support/index.md)
