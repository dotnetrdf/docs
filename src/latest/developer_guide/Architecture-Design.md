# Design

This section of the wiki covers design documents past and present for the library.  A lot of time design for simple features/fixes takes place via our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/dotnetrdf/dotnetrdf/issues) so only major features get covered here.  In particular from 0.5.0 onwards we have heavily relied upon the issue tracker to monitor design tasks.
